# WINDPoSDistributer

#Leasing definitely do not have WIND !!!

Rewards collected by the node within 24 hours are distributed as follows.

1- Leasing addresses more than 1000 blocks are not included in the calculation.

2- Transfer fee is deducted from the total balance in the account as much as the number of addresses to be distributed. (0.001 WIND * (number of wallets + 1))

3- 5% of the remaining balance is transferred to the address (ceo_addr), 95% of which is proportional to the leasing amount of the leasing wallets.

As a result of the distribution, the balance at leasing address remains close to zero.
